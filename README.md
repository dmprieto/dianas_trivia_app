## Diana's Trivia Mobile App :iphone:

### Purpose

Create a mobile application using React Native to showcase my skills in React/React Native. I'll also explore using Tailwind for handling CSS.

After exploring the repo https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#games--comics , I selected **Open Trivia** https://opentdb.com/api_config.php as the datasource for the application.

After analizing the available data, I'll start with the design of the application.

### Setup

I'll be using expo to generate the main project

### Design

- [Data Analysis](/docs/DESIGN.MD "Data Analysis")
- [Sequence Diagrams](/docs/SEQUENCE.MD "Sequence Diagrams")
- [Quiz Flowchart]
